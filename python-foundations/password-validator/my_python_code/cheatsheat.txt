# --- Git Repo Setup --- #

# --- Terminal pt 1. --- # 
- git init to initialise a new git repository.
- Create some files to be added to the repository, for example:
  echo 'print("Hello, world!")' > example.py  # Create a Python file.
- git add example.py  # Stage the file(s) for commit.
- git commit -m "First commit"  # Commit the changes with a message.
- git status  # Check the status of your working directory and staged files.
- git log  # View the commit history.

# --- GitHub --- #
- Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the green "New" button.
- Name the repository (e.g., `my-repo`).
- Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
- Do NOT initialise with a README, .gitignore, or license (to avoid merge conflicts with your local repo).

# --- Terminal pt 2 --- #
- git remote -v  # View the current remotes (none should be listed initially).
- git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_URL>  # Link your local repo to the remote on GitHub.
- git remote -v  # Verify the remote was added (you should see `fetch` and `push` URLs for `origin`).
- git branch -M main  # Rename the default branch to `main` (if not already named `main`).
- git push -u origin main  # Push the code to the GitHub repository.
